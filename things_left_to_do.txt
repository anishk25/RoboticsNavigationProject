Project End Date: 9th May 2015 Project Days Left: 24

Things Left To Do:
- Basic Paper Counting in Hallway
- Navigation in one hallway
- Navigation in multiple hallways(shouldn't be too hard one one hallway is done, only tricky part is turning)
- Path planning(probably most challenging part, might not get to this)
- Sending messages to robot through server to tell where to go
